# Todo - App

This project was created using `create-react-app` with a **Redux** template

## Description

The project is designed to display the basic functionality of a mobile **To do** application. 

It was meant to help me solidify the understanding of Redux flow of information.

## Notes

- The application isn't responsive, it is designed for mobile screens only.
- It doesn't save data into local storage.

## How to run

### run `npm install`

### run `npm start`
